# CS-305
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that wishes to implement and apply the most current and effective software security.
  
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
  I think I was able to troubleshoot any issues I had fairly well and was able to get the code functional. It is imporatnt to code securly in order to prevent data leaks of sensitve information. This is important for a company well-being because customers will not want to use systems that have a reputation of having bad security.
  
What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
  The most challenging aspect was determine which vulnerabilities were false positives. None of the course material explained how to determine which vulnerabilities were false positives.
  
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
  In the future I would look at security best practices and make sure my code follows these best practices.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  After refactoring the code, I ran it again to make sure the behavior was the same. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  Maven Dependency check was a very helpful tool and I will probably use it again in the future.
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
  I would want to show an employer that I am able to run a dependency check and I am also able to suppress false positives once identified.
